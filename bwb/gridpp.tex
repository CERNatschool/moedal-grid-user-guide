\subsection{The GridPP UserGuide}
\label{sec:gridppuserguide}
%=============================================================================
Finally, you are strongly advised to read and work through the
user guide provided by the GridPP Collaboration~\cite{gridpp2006,gridpp2009}
on their website:

\href{http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/userguide}{http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/userguide}

This will get you up and running with the Grid software and
infrastructure supported by GridPP. You will also join the
\code{gridpp} Virtual Organisation as a ``new user''.

If some of the material in the GridPP UserGuide looks familiar,
don't be too surprised -- this guide was prepared by the same
author. Indeed, the integration of the MoEDAL Virtual Organisation
has served as a useful case study for GridPP's
New User Engagement Programme.

Right. Let's begin!
