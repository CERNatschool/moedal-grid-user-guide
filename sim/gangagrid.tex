\acs{DIRAC}~\cite{DIRAC2010}\footnote{%
See \href{http://diracgrid.org/}{http://diracgrid.org}} is a software
framework for distributed
computing that the GridPP Collaboration uses to manage
jobs and data on the Grid using their own
GridPP \ac{DIRAC} instance~\cite{GRIDPPDIRAC2015a,GRIDPPDIRAC2015b} --
so we're going to use it too.
To get started, we firstly need to change a few settings in our
Ganga configuration file to reflect the fact we're running
with the \ac{MoEDAL} \ac{VO}. Specifically, in your
\texttt{.gangarc} file (found in your home directory),
find and set the following variables:
 
\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=0,numbers=none,language=bash]
[defaults_DiracProxy]
...
group = vo.moedal.org_user
...
[DIRAC]
...
DiracLFNBase = /vo.moedal.org/user/l/lise.meitner
...
\end{lstlisting}

(Except use your own \ac{DFC} user space, of course!)

Then we initialise \ac{DIRAC} and generate a Grid proxy as usual:

\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=0,numbers=none,language=bash]
$ source /cvmfs/ganga.cern.ch/dirac_ui/bashrc
$ dirac-proxy-init -g vo.moedal.org_user -M
Generating proxy... 
Enter Certificate password:
[...output...]
\end{lstlisting}

Remember how we said switching to Grid running with Ganga was trivial?
Well, we just have to use a slightly script to create the Grid-ready job
and then submit it as before:

\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=0,numbers=none,language=bash]
Ganga In [x]: execfile('make_dirac_job.py') 
Ganga In [x]: j.submit()
\end{lstlisting}

And that's it!
You can check on the status of your job in the GridPP DIRAC
system by accessing the GridPP DIRAC page here:

\href{https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk}{https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk}

With a browser that has your grid certificate installed.
You should select \term{vo.moedal.org\_user} from the bottom-right
drop down menu, and then \term{Job Monitor} from the \term{Jobs} drop-down menu
in the top-left corner.

\begin{warningbox}{Submitting jobs to the Grid}
\emph{Submitting jobs to the grid can take some time.
You might want to make a cup of tea or do something else while waiting!}
\end{warningbox}

%If all has gone well,
%you should now be able to retrieve the job output as per the
%instructions in the GridPP UserGuide.

%\begin{hintbox}{Getting help with errors}
%\emph{If the job fails, or you get errors, remember the help
%contacts available in the GridPP UserGuide!}
